# Bikesharing

 **Overview of the analysis:**  
 The purpose of this analysis was to show empirical data for bike sharing in an effort to persuade investors in its viability. Using raw data from Citibike in New York, we were able to set up visualizations that allow larger audiences to understand the large dataset. 
 
**Results:**  
Below, we have compiled some of the results of our study:

Most trips were approximately 10 minutes in duration, with nearly all trips being shorter than 1 hour.

Males are the main users of bikesharing services.

Commuting hours seem to be primetime for bikesharing.

This pattern is consistent across both genders.

Most users are subscribers.

Starting and ending stations are centered in Manhattan and seem to be generally consistent in terms of traffic.

**Summary:**  
After viewing the visualizations of the NYC bike data, one can see that there are a lot of patterns in the data:

 - Most users are Male and have a current subscription
 - Most rides originate during commuting hours (7-9am, and 5-7pm on weekdays)
 - Start and end stations have consistency, meaning that some stations are simply more trafficked than others. 
 - Most rides start and end in Manhattan

Further suggested visualizations would be to gather additional data to learn more about female signup durations and station activity in other boroughs to see if there are opportunities for further expansion in either of those avenues.
